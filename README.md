Tools to look at animal home ranges.

A few home made tools to look at home range size. So far, the only file added is a way to calculate home range area using the ks package. Using the ks package is useful when you want to estimate the bandwith using methods such as plug-in. While the ks packae is useful to estimate the bandwith it's not straighforward how to estimate the are of the kernel. This is especially complicated with we have a distribution with multiple peaks and holes.
